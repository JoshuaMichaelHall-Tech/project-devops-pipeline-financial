# Automated DevOps Pipeline for Financial Applications

## ðŸš§ PROJECT STATUS: IN DEVELOPMENT

**Note**: This is an AI-generated project template created as part of my DevOps learning journey. Active development will begin as I progress through my CI/CD and GitHub Actions training.

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust CI/CD pipeline designed specifically for financial services applications, providing comprehensive security scanning, compliance validation, and automated deployment. The pipeline transitions code from development to production while enforcing security and compliance requirements at every stage.

> **Note**: This project is currently in the planning stage. Documentation and implementation will evolve as development progresses.

## Key Features

- Multi-environment deployment pipeline (dev, test, staging, production)
- Infrastructure validation with Terraform
- Automated security scanning for code and dependencies
- Compliance checks for financial regulations
- Approval workflows for sensitive environments
- Automated testing at all stages
- Deployment metrics and reporting

## Technologies

- GitHub Actions for CI/CD orchestration
- AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- SonarQube for code quality
- OWASP dependency scanning
- Terraform for infrastructure validation
- AWS CloudFormation Guard for policy enforcement
- JUnit, pytest for testing

## Business Value

This pipeline reduces application time-to-market while maintaining strict security controls, enabling financial organizations to deploy new features rapidly without compromising on security or compliance. It demonstrates how to reduce deployment time by 70% while enhancing security through automation and consistent processes.

## Getting Started

> Coming soon: Instructions for setting up the development environment and configuring the pipeline.

## Security Features

The pipeline implements multiple security controls:

1. **Static Code Analysis**: Automatically scans code for security vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Identifies vulnerable dependencies
3. **Infrastructure Validation**: Ensures infrastructure complies with security policies
4. **Secrets Management**: Prevents secrets from being exposed
5. **Approval Gates**: Requires manual approval for production deployments
6. **Compliance Reporting**: Generates reports for audit purposes

## Compliance and Security

This pipeline is designed to support compliance with:
- PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
- SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)
- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
